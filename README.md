# Tic Tac Toe (Infinitely Resizeable!)

*How the game works*
This game of tic tac toe works by first prompting the user to choose a size of board. It can be any size they want. Really-- if it's too big to fit on their screen, they can choose the option to play *in their minds* (where you can't see the board display). The rules are that the rows and columns will be equal (the baord is a square), and you win by getting one full row, column, or diagonal in a row. For example, if your board is 9 wide, you win by getting 9 in a row. Otherwise, no different from normal tic tac toe.

*How the code runs*
The main method includes a while loop that loops until the game is over. Print statements to the console are how the user interacts. There are two seperate methods-- check_win, which is used to check if a player has won each time they make a move, and print_board, which is used to print the board using characters to the console.
